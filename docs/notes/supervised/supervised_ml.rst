Description
------------

Supervised machine learning is the use of LABELED data to train models

There are two categories of supervised machine learning:

- Classification Models: Answers questions in the form of yes or no
    These models predict 'categorical outcome' of an item.
    For example, predict whether an email is a spam or not a spam.

- Regression Models: Answers questions in the form of how much
    These models predict 'numerical outcome' of an item.
    For example, predict the price of a house
